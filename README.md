# Enterprise Network Design

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an enterprise-level local area network (LAN) using VLANs and inter-VLAN routing.

## Project Overview
The network is designed for a medium-sized organization with multiple departments. Each department is placed in a separate VLAN to improve performance, organization, and security.

## Network Topology
- 1 Router
- 1 Layer 2 Switch
- 3 Departments (HR, IT, Finance)
- 2 PCs per department

## IP Addressing Scheme
| Department | VLAN ID | Network |
|------------|--------|---------|
| HR | 10 | 192.168.10.0/24 |
| IT | 20 | 192.168.20.0/24 |
| Finance | 30 | 192.168.30.0/24 |

## Technologies Used
